    "description": "# Introduction\n  \n  Equifax’s Consumer Credit Report is the leading consumer credit resource enabling lenders to make faster, more informed credit-granting decisions, better manage their risk and maximize growth opportunities. The Consumer Credit Report unites the power of superior consumer data with best-in-class search and match logic capabilities to deliver higher match rates on more inquiries.\n  \n# Getting Started\n\n1. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"_blank\">Create</a>** an application\n\n2. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>** to Consumer Credit Report API\n\n3. **<a href=\"/products/consumer-credit-report\" target=\"_blank\">Explore</a>** the Sandbox environment\n\n# Promoting to UAT\n\nTo successfully submit test transactions through your application in the UAT environment, a test member number is required.  You may use your existing Equifax test member number(s).  Please contact your Equifax Account Representative if a new test member number is needed. The steps below can be used to test in the UAT environment.\n\nTransactions generated using a test member number do not return identical results as a sandbox transaction.  A sandbox transaction will reflect everything that is exposed in the API whereas a test member number is configured to align with the specifications of your contract. Please contact us to ensure your test member number is configured to your expectations.    \n\n1. **<a href=\"/user/applications\" target=\"_blank\">Promote</a>** application to test\n\n2. **<a href=\"/documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Update</a>** requests details for UAT\n\n3. **<a href=\"/documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Test</a>** scenarios in UAT environment\n\n\n# For More Details\n\n  * **<a href=\"/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Us</a>** - Equifax Developer Center Support Website\n  * **ACRO Migration Support**\n      * phone: 1-888-407-0359; Option 2 followed by Option 5  \n      * email:  BT.Acro.tech@equifax.com\n      \n",
