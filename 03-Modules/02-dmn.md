# Decision Model and Notation - DMN

## Overview
- Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is used to model decision service graphically.
- It is a standard established by the **Object Management Group (OMG)** for describing and modeling operational decisions.
- DMN decision model are determined by below
  - **DRD:** 
    - A decision requirements diagrams trace business decisions from start to finish.
    - Each decision node use logic defined in DMN boxed expressions such as decision tables.
    - A DRD can represent part or all of the DMN model.
    - DRD components and connector details are available [here](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/#_using_dmn_models_in_kogito_services)
  - **DRG:**
    - A Decision Requirements Graph models a domain of decision-making, showing the most important elements involved in it and the dependencies between them.
    - The elements modeled are **decisions**, **input data**, and **knowledge sources**. 
    - The visual representation of a DRG is called DRD.
- Kogito provides design and runtime support for **DMN 1.2** models at **conformance level 3**.
- It provides runtime-only support for DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models at conformance level 3. 
- DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models are currently not supported in the Kogito DMN modeler.

## FEEL
- Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) is an expression language defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) DMN specification.
- FEEL is designed to facilitate both decision modeling and execution by assigning semantics to the decision model constructs.

    | Number                    	| Numbers in FEEL are based on the IEEE 754-2008 Decimal 128 format, with 34 digits of precision.<br>Internally, numbers are represented in Java as BigDecimals with MathContext DECIMAL128.<br>It is used to represent both integers and floating-point numbers. FEEL numbers use a dot (.) as a decimal separator.<br><br>FEEL does not support -INF, +INF, or NaN. <br>FEEL uses null to represent invalid numbers.<br><br>Kogito extends DMN specification and supports additional number notations<br>- **Scientific:** Suffix *e<exp> or E<exp>*. For example, 1.2e3 or 1.2E3 = 1.2*10**3<br>- **Hexadecimal:** Prefix *0x*. For example, 0xff or 0XFF = 255 	|

- The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a **function**, **context**, **range**, or **list**, but Kogito extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of these types. Details of these types are given below:
